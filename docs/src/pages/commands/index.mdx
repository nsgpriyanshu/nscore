# Getting Started

Follow these steps:

To add the app to your server, follow these steps:

1. Click on the invitation [link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=943458326644150323) provided by the app's developer.
2. Select the server where you want to add the app or install it on your account.
3. Authorize the app with the necessary `permissions`.

Ensure the app has the correct `permissions` to perform its tasks effectively.

## Permissions

At the time of installation, nsCore won't ask for `administrative` permissions. To enhance security for your Discord server, we have set the app like this. However, if you want to use the `administrative` features, you can check out the required permissions in the respective commands docs!

<Callout>
  We highly suggest giving only the necessary required permissions, don't give unnecessary
  permissions!
</Callout>

## Message Commands

The prefix of our nsCore app is `ns.`, we tried our best to keep it simple and unique!

<Callout type="info">
  As this documentation serves as Power Op's docs, it's necessary for you to know that the __prefix
  of Power Op app is__ `Op.`, this isn't mentioned in the command docs section, so don't panic!
</Callout>

## Slash Commands

Currently, we don't support slash commands completely, also, a very low number of people are using slash commands, so we didn't focus much on them! But soon, all the commands will support interactions too!
