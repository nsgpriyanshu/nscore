# Introducing **nsCore**

- Welcome to the official documentation of nsCore app (bot). This is an informative Discord app (bot) written by nsgpriyansu using TypeScript, JavaScript, and discord.js!

- This documentation is divided into two parts: one for end users (Discord users) and the other for developers!

## About

It is designed to provide a wide range of features and commands to enhance your Discord server experience. Whether you're looking for moderation tools or informational resources, ns Core app (bot) has you covered. With its user-friendly interface and powerful functionality, ns Core app (bot) aims to elevate your Discord community to the next level.

## Users Section

This section is exclusively for end users who encounter problems using our app (bot) or are confused about commands. Please check out our [command](https://nsgpriyanshu.github.io/nscore/commands/) docs for a brief description of all commands with examples!

## Developers Section

As this is an open-source Discord app, we believe it's important to provide a developer guide. Existing guides are quite basic, so I've created this comprehensive guide, covering everything from npm installation to command usage. Please check out the dev guide [here](https://nsgpriyanshu.github.io/nsdocs).

## Thank you

- For using our app! We hope this guide will assist you in your coding journey! Happy coding :)
